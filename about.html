      <div class="about-text-col">
        <p>When I was a child, I have always been fascinated by how the Universe works. I have had many interests growing up, and I find art and science to be my favorite subjects. I decided to become an engineer because I view engineering as one of the most beautiful arts out there. This reliance on technology has altered the logistics of humanity in an unprecedented manner and has provided an advanced domain for society to operate. I've worked my way to get into a really good engineering university known as Texas A&M, and I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering. The computer science/computer engineering path is one of the most versatile engineering disciplines because you can specialize in a variety of subjects such as programming, hardware, IT, cybersecurity, game design, and more. As a student at Texas A&M, I decided to become a Peer Teacher to give back to the University and to help other students. Many members in the department have set an example for a wonderful learning environment, and it has inspired me to help others. My mission is to use what I learn to contribute to mankind's innovation and make the world of tomorrow a better place for all life.</p>
