                <h2>My Mission</h2>
                    <p> When I was a child I have always been fascinated how the Universe works. 
                        I have had many interest growing up and I find art and sciene to be my favorite subjects. I decided to become an
                        engineer because I view engineering as one of the most beatiful arts out there. 
                        The computer has been one of the most impactful tools ever derived from man.  
                        Many aspects of our everyday lives rely on computers such as cars, schools, cellphones, medical services, entertainment, weather services, banking, stocking, and much more. 
                        Our species rely on this invention to the point I would argue that most people operate similarly to cyborgs.
                        This reliance on technology has altered the logistics of humanity in an unprecedented manner and has provided an advanced domain for society to operate. 
                        I've worked my way to get into a really good engineering university known as Texas A&M and I am curretnly majoring in Computer Engineering. 
                        The computer science/computer engineering path is one of the most versatile engineering disciplines because you can specialize in a variety of subjects such as programming, hardware, IT, cyber security, game design, and more. Subjects involving computing will always be aiding in STEM innovations. I currently would like to one day be a part of continuing mankind's exploration into the stars. It is something that I am very passionate about and I believe humanity has an unlimited potential when it comes to achieving its goals. As a student at Texas A&M I decided to become a Peer Teacher to give back to the University, and to help 
                        other students. Many members in the department have set an example for a wonderful learning enviorement 
                        and it has inspired me to help others. My mission is to use what I learn to contribute to mankind's innovation 
                        and the make the world of tommorow a better place for all life
